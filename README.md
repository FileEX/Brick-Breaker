# Compilation 
1. Clone repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/FileEX/Brick-Breaker.git
```
3. Run the ``generate_project.bat`` file.
4. Open the generated .sln file in the ``build`` directory.
5. Set the **Brick_Breaker** project as the startup project (Right-click â†’ 'Set as Startup Project').
(Yeah, I know it might seem dumb, but for some reason, CMake creates an additional ALL_BUILD project and sets it as the startup one.)
6. Compile the project.
7. Everything is ready to run!
